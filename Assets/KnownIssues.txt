TODO:

-Test Mac and Linux Blender plugin install paths.

-Test Mac and Linux builds.

-Test importing various file formats.

-UI for In-App mesh combining tool, transform controls, material ID filler, array modifiers, deform modifiers, subdivision, decimation, quad editing tools.

-Improve the quad wireframe shader and remove the other wireframe shaders.

-Improve name extension for imports with duplicate names.

-Add in app credits.

-Code comments, docs and copyright notice overhaul.

BUGS:

-Blender live link throws missing bl_rna when the addon is enabled in blender.

-All category does not update after an import. (needs verification, may be just in the Unity Editor) likely needs a wait to check if/when the files have been saved to the users computer before updating the browser.

-Results don't update when an item is moved to another category.

-On pressing return from the mesh inspector camera position and rotation are not reset, the camera orbit script overrides the values.
